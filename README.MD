## Mapping APIs
A mapping APIs (Application Program Interface) allows you to integrate and communicate with map services, so you can develop a new application or expand the functionality of an existing one. These APIs usually include classes for maps and layers to make it easy to create, edit and display a map without needing to code all of the low-level logistics. We offer a complete mapping and analytics solutions for developers. Low price, easy to use, secure, high performance.

## Our APIs
Our APIs are intuitive, easy to use and you can white label all of them, putting you in control of your customer’s experience.

You can use our APIs to provide services to individual or business customers.

## Our advantages
We use unique geocoding algorithms and data. We don't use open street map and other free/open source maps. Our maps are not created by volunteers, but by experienced GIS analysts, cartographers, and scientists. We partner with premier data providers to give users the most current and accurate local data available.

### GEOCODING API
The Geocoding API is a service that provides geocoding and reverse geocoding. Geocoding is the process of converting addresses into geo-coordinates (latitude, longitude). Reverse geocoding is the process of converting geo-coordinates into a street address. We use unique geocoding algorithms and data.

### DIRECTIONS API
The Directions API is a service that calculates directions between locations. You can find the best route between two or more locations, route optimization, route geometry, turn-by-turn instructions, etc. Help your users provide reliable directions anywhere in the world, choose faster routes or streamline delivery systems.

### ORIGIN-DESTINATION MATRIX API
The origin-destination matrix API is a service that provides travel time and distance between multiple origins and destinations at once.
